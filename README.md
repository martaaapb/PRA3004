This repository contains the final codes for each of the five weeks lab sessions. 
Due to GPU shortage, I was unable to completely train the computer, I got super weird faces (funny though) but never real faces.
I wrote an extension on the code to be able to choose certain aspects like eye colour or gender, but I was not able to implemented. 
Hopefully someone will and will correct the code to both optimize it and simplify it. Thank you!!!
